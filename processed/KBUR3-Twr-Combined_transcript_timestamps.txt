[2290.82s - 2292.66s]  Avalo 1-9-3, standby, let me coordinate
[2293.62s - 2311.22s]  Avalo 1-9-3, uh, right now there's, uh, no delay, uh, there is a, uh, uh, Beechcraft 99 on a, uh, 12-mile final, but they're already VFR, but they are out there, they're on a 12-mile final, 12-mile final for Runway 8, uh, so when do you think you can be airborne?
[2312.50s - 2314.34s]  Less than five minutes for Avalo 1-9-3
[2315.22s - 2319.78s]  Avalo 1-9-3, roger, okay, expect no delay, just give me a call when you're number one and holding short

[2329.62s - 2338.66s]  Yeah, 2-1-0-7, we're sitting on the ground at Burbank, just curious, are you giving the clearances out of here, or, uh, are we expecting to get our pre-departure clearance as normal?
[2339.62s - 2353.94s]  Uh, for your clearance, you're going to have to call the 1-800 number, uh, it is 1-800-448-3724, extension 1
[2355.30s - 2357.30s]  Okay, copy all, we'll call that, thank you
[2358.34s - 2366.98s]  Burbank traffic, Avalo 1-9-3, we're crossing Runway 15 at Bravo 2 to go to Alpha to hold short Runway 15, number one for departure, Burbank traffic
[2366.98s - 2396.02s]  Burbank airport traffic, Avalo 1-9-3, hold for release, it's going to be probably about, uh, 3 to 5 minutes, there's a, uh, I'm just worried about that Beechcraft 99 for Runway 8, so once I can verify that he's no factor, you can expect your clearance
[2397.22s - 2405.30s]  Avalo 1-9-3, Amtlight 1947, I know you're on short final, but, uh, let me know when you are off of Runway 8

[2415.14s - 2428.02s]  Burbank traffic, Amtlight 1947, ABE-99, uh, 2-mile final on Runway 8, traffic, this is Bravo to the north side, Amtlight 1947, Burbank traffic
[2428.98s - 2448.98s]  Avalo 1-9-3, um, you know, I hate to do this to you, but, uh, I just don't feel comfortable because I don't have eyes out there, um, after that first Amtlight, there's going to be another Amtlight, they're on a, uh, 9-mile final for Runway 8, and then there's a southwest, um, also for Runway 8 right behind them, so it's going to be probably about
[2449.94s - 2452.18s]  No worries, safety first, Avalo 1-9-3
[2453.06s - 2460.74s]  SoCalPolice100, uh, we're in the Burbank airspace, is there something we can help you with, uh, eyes from up here and let you know if they're clear of the runway?
[2461.46s - 2469.06s]  And, uh, I don't know who asked that question, but, uh, we have ground radar, so I, I kind of can see when they're leaving the runway, I just wanted to make sure

[2512.26s - 2516.10s]  then take Bravo to Bravo 2, and turn right at Bravo 2 to cross 1-5
